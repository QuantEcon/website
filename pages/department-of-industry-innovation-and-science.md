# QuantEcon Workshop for the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science

On April 10th 2019, QuantEcon will run a one day workshop on Python for computational economics and econometrics. The workshop is aimed at beginners to Python, although some prior coding experience in other programming languages is preferable.

Topics will include an introduction to Python, scientific computing (overview), major scientific libraries in Python, and applications in economics, statistical analysis and data science.

**Spaces for the workshop have now been filled.**

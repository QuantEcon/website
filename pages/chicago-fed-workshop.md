### Summary

[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/) are are attracting rapidly growing interest as languages for scientific computing that successfully combine high productivity and high performance. This workshop will provide an intensive, three day introduction to programming in Python and Julia, centered around the needs and interests of economists. Some of the content will be based on lectures from [lectures.quantecon.org](https://lectures.quantecon.org/).

### Resources

Material for the workshop is available from the [workshop GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/ChicagoFed_workshop)

### Instructions for Attendees

The workshop will be hands on and centered around a combination of lectures and exercises. Participants are asked to bring laptops.

# QuantEcon 2018 Honours Workshop with Thomas J. Sargent

On March 10th 2018, QuantEcon will run a one day workshop on modern methods in computational and dynamic modeling, aimed at incoming honours students in economics across Australia.  The workshop, to be held in Canberra, will include a lecture from and discussion with 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences Thomas J. Sargent. 

Topics will include an introduction to scientific computing with Python, basic principles of software engineering and an introduction to macroeconomic and financial modeling using computational techniques. Funding for travel and accommodation will be offered to selected interstate students.

The workshop is supported by the Research School of Economics at Australian National University and [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

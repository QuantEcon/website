            <p>Open source scientific computing environments built around the Python programming language have expanded
                rapidly in recent years. They now form the dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence and many fields
                within the natural sciences. Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing
                capabilities by exploiting Python's scientific ecosystem. This course will cover the foundations of
                Python programming and Python scientific libraries, discuss their connection to economic applications,
                and also investigate how Python is being used as the major language of AI.</p>

            <p>Several important new scientific computing environments have appeared in recent years, generated by
                demand from and investment in artificial intelligence. This workshop will provide a brief overview of
                these environments and their features, including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and
                just-in-time compilers. We will discuss how these tools can be applied to a range of economic
                applications. When possible, attendees should bring laptops to the seminar.</p>

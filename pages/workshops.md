# Workshops and Seminars

QuantEcon runs workshops on computational modeling for economists using Python and Julia. 

## Recent Workshops

**November 2024, Reserve Bank of Australia**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [The AI-driven Revolution in Scientific Computing](https://github.com/QuantEcon/rba_workshop_2024)

>Several important new scientific computing environments have appeared in recent years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence. This workshop will provide a brief overview of these environments and their features, including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time compilers. We will discuss how these tools can be applied to a range of economic applications. When possible, attendees should bring laptops to the seminar.

**August 2024, University of Melbourne**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [Computional Economics Workshop](https://github.com/QuantEcon/melbourne_2024)

>Several new open source scientific computing environments have appeared in recent years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence and related fields. Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing capabilities by exploiting these new computational tools. This workshop will provide a brief overview of core topics, including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time compilers. We will discuss how these tools can be applied to a range of economic applications.

**May 2024, Central Bank of Chile**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [Central Bank of Chile 2024 Scientific Computing Workshop](https://github.com/QuantEcon/cbc_2024)

>Open source scientific computing environments built around the Python programming language have expanded rapidly in recent years. They now form the dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence and many fields within the natural sciences. Economists can greatly enhance their modeling and data processing capabilities by exploiting Python's scientific ecosystem. This course will cover the foundations of Python programming and Python scientific libraries, as well as showing how they can be used in economic applications for rapid development and high performance computing.

**March 2024, International Monetary Fund (Institute for Capacity Development)**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [Modern Computational Economics and Policy Applications](https://github.com/QuantEcon/imf_2024)

**October 2023, International Monetary Fund**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [An Introduction to High Performance Computing with Python](https://github.com/QuantEcon/imf_october_2023)

>This workshop will give an overview of Python's high performance computing capabilities and how they can be used for economic modeling. We will cover JIT compilers, automation differentiation, cloud computing and GPUs. Attendees should bring their own laptop, but no software installs are necessary.

**October 2023, Columbia University**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [Computational Methods for Quantitative Economics](https://github.com/QuantEcon/columbia_2023)

**April 2023, Kobe University**

*   Presenters: John Stachurski
*   [Computational Economics with Python](https://github.com/QuantEcon/kobe_comp_econ_2023)

>Computational methods and scientific computing are becoming increasingly central to research, analysis and policy work in economics, finance and social science.
>This is an introductory workshop for students and policy makers who are interested in learning about the evolution of modern scientific computing tools and how they can be applied to economic problems. The main language used in the workshop will be Python, although other languages will also be discussed.
>Topics will include simulation, vectorization, JIT compilers, and parallelization.

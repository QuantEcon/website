We're pleased to announce a new lecture on [Advanced Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/): **[Gorman Aggregation with Heterogeneous Households](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/gorman_aggregation.html)**.

## About the Lecture

This lecture explores one of the fundamental questions in macroeconomic theory: under what conditions can an economy with diverse households be analyzed as if there were a single representative consumer?

Key topics covered include:

- **Gorman aggregation conditions**: When household demand can be aggregated regardless of income distribution
- **Linear Engel curves**: The role of quasi-homothetic preferences in enabling aggregation
- **Practical implications**: Understanding when representative agent models are appropriate approximations

## Why This Matters

Representative agent models are ubiquitous in macroeconomics, but their validity depends on specific conditions that aren't always met. This lecture provides the theoretical foundations for understanding:

- When aggregation is justified
- What heterogeneity matters for aggregate outcomes
- How to think about distributional effects in macro models

The lecture includes computational examples and exercises to reinforce the theoretical concepts.

## Contributors

This lecture was developed by Humphrey Yang and Thomas Sargent.

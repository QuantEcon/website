 QuantEcon has launched [A First Course in Quantitative Economics with Python](https://intro.quantecon.org/intro.html), a first lecture series that introduces quantitative economics using elementary mathematics and statistics plus computer code written in Python and that emphasize simulation and visualization through code as a way to convey ideas, rather than focusing on mathematical details. A big thank you to Shu Hu, Smit Lunagariya, Matthew McKay, Maanasee Sharma, Humphrey Yang, Chien Yeh and Hengcheng Zhang, along with other research assistants at QuantEcon, for their invaluable contributions in creating these lectures.

The QuantEcon organization is closing the discourse forum (running since 2016) hosted at
[discourse.quantecon.org](https://discourse.quantecon.org).

We have recently observed a large increase in spam posts. As the forum was not seeing high usage rates
we felt the maintenance cost was higher than the benefit it was bringing to the broader community. 

We are still dedicated to encouraging community linkages and discussion and will be evaluating new
platforms and opportunities. We are also looking at developing AI tutors for our lecture sites.

Thank you to everyone that participated in the forums.

[QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/) is migrating from the [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/quantecon) based forum to a new discussion forum built on [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/). The new forum is located at [http://discourse.quantecon.org/](http://discourse.quantecon.org/) and is also linked through the QuantEcon [org](http://quantecon.org/) and [lecture](http://lectures.quantecon.org/) websites. Please feel free to join the conversation, make suggestions for improvements, or tell us what project you’d like to see the QuantEcon team work on next.

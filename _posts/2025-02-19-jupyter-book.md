The QuantEcon organization is a founding member of the [Executable Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) project that built [Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/tools/#tools-jupyter-book) and [MyST Markdown](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/tools/#tools-myst)

We are really excited to share that Jupyter Book has now been accepted as a Jupyter sub-project.

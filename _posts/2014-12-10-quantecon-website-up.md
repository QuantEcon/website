Our lectures draw heavily on code from two parallel code libraries, [QuantEcon.py](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py) and [QuantEcon.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl). These libraries have been unified under the QuantEcon project, and a website for the project is now [up and running](http://quantecon.org/). The code libraries are separate entities from the lectures and are constructed in the usual open source way. All manner of contributions are welcome, from documentation improvements and minor bug fixes to new algorithms and models. More details can be found [here](http://quantecon.org/get_involved.html). Thanks to Matt McKay and Andrij Stachurski for most of the leg work in getting the new website on line.

QuantEcon is showcasing the 2020 student projects taught with the QuantEcon [Data Science](datascience.quantecon.org) lecture series.

The students covered

* Python Fundamentals
* Scientific Computing and Economics
* Introduction to Pandas and Data Wrangling

Many of the students had limited to no exposure to programming prior to the course. These projects are a testimony to their hard work.

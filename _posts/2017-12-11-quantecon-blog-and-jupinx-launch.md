We've just launched the [QuantEcon blog](http://blog.quantecon.org/) to share more information about the work we do at QuantEcon and provide greater insight into the tools we use. Our first post, [Introducing Jupinx](https://medium.com/quantecon-blog/introducing-jupinx-60ba9fc12f4f), details the new Sphinx extension we've developed to allow users to easily convert text files to Jupyter notebooks. If you'd like to install Jupinx or contribute to the package, you can find information on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter). Thanks to [Matthew McKay](https://github.com/mmcky), [Akira Matsushita](https://github.com/myuuuuun), and [Nick Sifniotis](https://github.com/NickSifniotis) for their hard work on Jupinx.

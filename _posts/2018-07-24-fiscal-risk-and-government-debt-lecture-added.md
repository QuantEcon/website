A [new Python lecture](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/amss3.html) studying government debt over time has been added to our dynamic programming squared section. The lecture builds on previous optimal taxation lectures ([here](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/opt_tax_recur.html) and [here](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/amss.html)) and extends them to an economy with three Markov states. In the long-run, this economy exhibits behaviour close to that described in the two-state case. The new lecture can be found [here](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/amss3.html).

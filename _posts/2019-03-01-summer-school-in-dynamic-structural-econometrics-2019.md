Applications are now open for the Econometric Society's Summer School in Dynamic Structural Econometrics (DSE). The summer school will be held at Booth School of Business and the Becker Friedman Institute for Economics at the University of Chicago from July 8 to July 14, 2019.  

The  primary  focus  of  DSE  summer schools is to provide students with tools and “hands on" computational instruction to carry  out  research  in  applied  microeconometrics  with  strong  emphasis  on  closely integrating economic and econometric theory in empirical work. We will discuss state-of-the-art  methods  for  solving,  simulating  and  estimating  dynamic  programming models and use a variety of empirical applications to illustrate how these tools and methods are used in practice.  

The 2019 Econometric Society DSE summer school consists of 5 days of lectures held in conjunction with the 3rd Conference on Structural Dynamic Models (July 10- 11, 2019). Besides the core components, including single agent models, equilibrium models,  and dynamic games, the course will also feature applications that follow the special theme of this year’s conference, "Industrial  organization, marketing and business analytics."  

The DSE summer school and conference takes place in conjunction with the six week Open Source Economics Laboratory Boot Camp at the University of Chicago.  

Interested  students  are  invited to submit their applications via the summer school website [http://dseschool.org](https://intouch.designbrooklyn.com/t/r-l-jtkjkjul-kthjuydthi-k/ "https://intouch.designbrooklyn.com/t/r-l-jtkjkjul-kthjuydthi-k/") before April 15, 2019\. Students interested in also attending the full 6 week boot camp should submit applications to the OSM website [https://www.oselab.org](https://intouch.designbrooklyn.com/t/r-l-jtkjkjul-kthjuydthi-u/ "https://intouch.designbrooklyn.com/t/r-l-jtkjkjul-kthjuydthi-u/") before March 15, 2019.

All applicants must be a member of the Econometric Society at the time of application.

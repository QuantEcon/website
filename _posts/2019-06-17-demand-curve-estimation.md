One of the most important quantitative problems in economics is demand curve estimation in differentiated product markets.  The best known modern algorithm is the so-called BLP method, due to Steven Berry, James Levinsohn and Ariel Pakes.  In a significant step forward for computational modeling, Chris Conlon and Jeff Gortmaker have developed a sophisticated Python implementation called [pyBLP](https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyblp). A corresponding [set of notebooks](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5cd236014174bb001a39a904) can be found at [QE notes](https://notes.quantecon.org/).

The [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/) series has been expanded with significant new content on income fluctuation problems and wealth inequality.

## New Lecture Content

- **Transient Income Shocks**: A new lecture separating transient shocks from the core IFP model, providing clearer theoretical exposition
- **Wealth Inequality Analysis**: New exercises analyzing how return volatility and labor income volatility affect wealth distribution
- **Stochastic Returns**: Improved simulation methods for studying wealth dynamics under uncertainty

## Key Findings Highlighted

The new content demonstrates important economic insights:

- Varying return volatility (capital income risk) has a much larger impact on wealth inequality than labor income volatility
- The lectures include Gini coefficient calculations showing how different parameter choices affect wealth distribution

## Technical Improvements

- **Performance optimizations** using `jax.lax.while_loop` for better JAX compatibility
- **Cleaner code structure** with improved function signatures and better variable naming
- **Enhanced visualizations** of wealth dynamics and distribution

These updates reflect ongoing research collaboration and were developed with contributions from John Stachurski.

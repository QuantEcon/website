We've completed a significant reorganization of lectures across two of our Python lecture sites to improve content flow and learning progression.

**Optimal Savings Lectures (python.quantecon.org)**

The [Intermediate Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/) series has undergone a major restructuring of the optimal savings content:

- **Renamed and reorganized** the income fluctuation problem (IFP) lectures for clearer progression
- **Added dynamics plots** and adjusted parameters for better visualization
- **Improved code organization** with consistent function signatures across lectures
- **Enhanced JAX implementations** with unified operator signatures between standard and JAX versions

**Parallel Programming Lectures (python-programming.quantecon.org)**

The [Python Programming for Economics and Finance](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/) site now features reorganized parallel programming content:

- **Restructured table of contents** for better topic flow
- **Improved content** on NumPy vs Numba vs JAX comparisons
- **Better explanations** of parallel computing concepts

These updates were developed with contributions from John Stachurski, Humphrey Yang, and Matt McKay.

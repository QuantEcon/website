Congratulations to [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com/), who was recognized at the [inaugural NumFOCUS Awards Dinner](https://numfocus.org/blog/inaugural-numfocus-awards-and-new-contributor-recognition) for his contributions to QuantEcon. Jesse has recently coordinated and contributed to QuantEcon’s efforts to support Julia 1.0. Jesse’s knowledge of our [online lectures](https://lectures.quantecon.org/index.html), having used QuantEcon materials to teach a class at University of British Columbia, has been invaluable to improving their usefulness for users. As part of this work, Jesse has also involved new research assistants to help build the infrastructure and test the lectures.

Two new lectures discuss how to protect respondents' privacy while accounting for selection biases in randomized surveys. [Randomized Response Surveys](https://python.quantecon.org/rand_resp.html) provides an introduction to using probability to design a survey such that the designer is unaware of individuals' responses, particularly when they may belong to a stigmatized group. [Expected Utilities of Random Responses](https://python.quantecon.org/util_rand_resp.html#utilitarian-view-of-survey-design) considers how to optimally design a survey with privacy protections using an expected utility approach.

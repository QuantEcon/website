A [new lecture](http://quant-econ.net/py/discrete_dp.html) on discrete dynamic programming has been added to the the Python side of quant-econ.net. It demonstrates how to exploit some very high quality code for solving infinite horizon discrete dynamic programming problems written by [Daisuke Oyama](https://github.com/oyamad). We plan to develop a Julia version over the next few months. Please get in touch if you are interested in helping out on porting this code to Julia.

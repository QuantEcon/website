QuantEcon is partnering with the Centre for Innovative Data in Economics (CIDE) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) to collaborate on open-source software and online textbooks in computational economics. As a first step, [Jesse Perla](http://jesseperla.com/) and his team at UBC have worked to revise and update the [Julia version of our lectures](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/). CIDE and QuantEcon’s collaborative efforts will also help the Vancouver School of Economics offer a new undergraduate course on data science and machine learning in economics in January 2019.

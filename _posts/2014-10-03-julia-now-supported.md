After a fair bit of work we’re finally ready to set loose on the world a Julia version of our lectures, as well as a nice new front end for the website. Most credit goes to our talented RAs Chase Coleman, Spencer Lyon and Matt McKay. Credit for the new website design and implementation goes to Andrij Stachurski.

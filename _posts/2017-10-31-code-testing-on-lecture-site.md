QuantEcon has implemented automatic code testing on the [lecture website](https://lectures.quantecon.org/)! The code testing tool, developed by Matthew McKay, Akira Matsushita and Nick Sifniotis, runs every code snippet embedded in the site nightly on our build server. Errors trigger an alert to the QuantEcon team, allowing us to fix them as they occur.  We'll document and open source this tool in the coming weeks.
